/**
 * <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight/java/example">refactoring.guru</a><br/>
 * 
 * <b>Usage examples</b>: The Flyweight pattern has a single purpose: minimizing memory intake. 
 * If your program doesn’t struggle with a shortage of RAM, 
 * then you might just ignore this pattern for a while.<br>
 * 
 * <b>Rendering a forest</b>
 *  In this example, we’re going to render a forest (1.000.000 trees)! 
 *  Each tree will be represented by its own object that has some state (coordinates, texture and so on). 
 *  Although the program does its primary job, naturally, it consumes a lot of RAM.<br/>
 *  
 *  The reason is simple: too many tree objects contain duplicate data (name, texture, color). 
 *  That’s why we can apply the Flyweight pattern and store these values 
 *  inside separate flyweight objects (the TreeType class). 
 *  Now, instead of storing the same data in thousands of Tree objects, 
 *  we’re going to reference one of the flyweight objects with a particular set of values.<br/>
 *
 *  The client code isn’t going to notice anything since the complexity of reusing 
 *  flyweight objects is buried inside a flyweight factory.<br/>
